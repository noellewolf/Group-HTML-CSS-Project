  <h1 class="center">Hi, I'm Noelle Wolf</h1>
</head>
<body>
  <p>I'm an 18-year-old software developer living in the St. Louis area.</p>
    <h2 class="center">Here Are My Hobbies!</h2>
    <p>In my spare time, I find myself reading Sci-Fi novels and watching various things on Youtube. Sometimes it's people modifying their cars, video game speed runs, or wildlife documentaries. Depends on what I'm feeling that day. Usually I put the Youtube videos on in the background while I play games like Red Dead Redemption 2, NieR: Automata, or Pokemon. As of now, I play and own 3 guitars, 3 ukuleles, 1 violin, 1 kalimba, and an ocarina. I'm not particularly amazing at any of them, but I've always loved having a music as a creative outlet. 
    <h3 class="center">Here Are My Passions!</h3>
    <p>Having gone through the losses that I have, it's become clear to me that my main passion is to be a person that the family and friends I've lost could be proud of. I want to work to raise not only myself up, but also the people around me by giving back to those who could use a boost. While it's hard for me to practice philanthropy at my financial state, I still find time to volunteer and show my appreciation for the ones I love with more sentimental gestures. It's important to me that I leave the people I love the same way my loved ones left me: with memories of altruism and a pure heart.</p>
